# Telepresence robot PCBs
This repository contains PCB designs that could be used to create a mobile telepresence robot based on a Raspberry Pi.
They are stored in Fritzing format.
The PCB section in those files is the one I develop the most.
Therefore, the other sections are likely auto-generated and not very well-designed.
